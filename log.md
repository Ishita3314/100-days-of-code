    1) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/yet-another-easy-problem-1f3273a0/ <br>
    2) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/counting-frog-paths-1abd84d5/ <br>
    3) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/almost-golden-rectangular-1c9d72c0/ <br>

**Today's Progress**: <br>
-> Apparently stuck in a recursive loop! Studied some more concepts and did questions, will try to finish recursion this weekend. <br>
-> Completed Basic CSS from https://freecodecamp.org/learn/Studied  <br> 
    
**Thoughts:** I'll sound like a broken record, but I'll say it anyway, it's difficult to manage college classes and assignments. Urgent enhancement of time management skills required!
