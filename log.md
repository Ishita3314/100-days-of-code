# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 15th, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: <br>
-> Studied recursion and did some basic questions <br>
-> Completed basic HTML and HTML5 from https://freecodecamp.org/learn/ <br>
-> Did 3 questions of linear search from HackerEarth (easy level): <br>
    1) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/yet-another-easy-problem-1f3273a0/ <br>
    2) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/counting-frog-paths-1abd84d5/ <br>
    3) https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/searching/linear-search/practice-problems/algorithm/almost-golden-rectangular-1c9d72c0/ <br>
    
**Thoughts:** Slow start, did basic things, difficult to manage college studies side by side. Need to work on my time management skills!
